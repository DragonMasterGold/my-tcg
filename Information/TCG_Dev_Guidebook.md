My TCG Simulator Guide Book
The long term goal is to create a commercially viable product. The card game itself is what is most important. However the simulator is being made in a way to facilitate the best quality experience possible for playing that card game online with others.

The game is heavily inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh. However it is trying to be its own thing, with my own design philosophies.

Currently we are in an extremely early Alpha stage for the cards and the simulator. I have just begun play-testing the very first set of cards. There are all types of things that are subject to change. From major system mechanics down to exact wording on cards.
There are many major gameplay mechanics I have planned for the game that need more development and testing before being implemented.
There are many gameplay interactions that need to be more well defined and ironed out.
Short term cards might change constantly. But even long term the idea for card balancing is to change things often to try and keep as many cards as possible balanced and fun.

The simulator is in the same state. Countless things may need to be adjusted or changed to facilitate the growth of the game.
Nothing in the sim is locked in or untouchable. All of the code could be re-written from scratch if needed.
Right now it is up to a point where play-testing is possible with my friends online.
I would need to make a few more adjustments before feeling fully ready to launch it for sale.
The launching process would heavily involve Kickstarter as a platform I currently am familiar with shipping projects through. (As a pro writer for Novels and Manga).
The card game also has a 500 chapter companion story that influences the design but both the card game and story stand independently from one another.

I plan to launch in stages.
A playable version of the sim, with either the first 1-to-2 sets of cards. Trying to get an Alpha testing group of paid Early Access players to start play-testing the Competitive Card Game so I can get more feedback for improvements.
Aiming for around an initial release to about 100 players.
With further pushes aiming to open up the game to more people.

The game is currently being hosted on my own Cloud Hetzner server that I am using to host other important career things, such as webpages and Email SeS.

I basically have no coding experience. This has been entirely vibe coded thus far. I need a lot of help and to depend on you for basically everything.
However, I would prefer to talk through changes before implementing them and build the game in a way that supports a solid foundation for long term additions.
Including utilizing the road map to have an idea about general features to come.

The long term goal is to eventually have full support along the lines of a simulator like Yugioh Omega or Master Duel.
But we are building there in stages.
Currently we have a nearly entirely manual simulator.

Eventually we would build out more base automations.
Then build a semi-automatic mode that can be toggled on and off.
Until eventually building out a fully automatic mode which could handle all game actions smoothly like a fully fleshed out video game.
