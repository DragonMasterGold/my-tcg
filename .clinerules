# Core Project Rules for My TCG Simulator

# --- General Philosophy & UI ---
- **Primary Goal:** Facilitate the best quality online play-testing experience.
- **UI Theme:** Use the existing dark blue/black theme (like #3498db for accents).
- **Automation:** Build features with future automation in mind (manual -> semi-auto -> full-auto).
- **Design Process:** Prefer modular code (helper functions) that can be easily extended. Always talk through complex changes before implementing.

# --- Card & Game Mechanics ---
- **Card ID:** Always use the unique card `id` for tracking, not just the name.
- **Keywords:** Keywords are critical. Use the `injectKeywords` function. Ensure special keyword rules (like 'Copy' or 'Flip:') are handled with priority.
- **Summoning Points (SP):** Phantoms cost SP = Level. Unsummon refunds SP = current Level. `autoSP` toggle dictates if costs are applied. Special Summons are free. Clone does not cost SP.

# --- Battle System Rules ---
- **Initiate Attack (B):** Selects Attacker. Must be Phantom, face-up, not rotated.
- **Target for Attack (B):** Selects Target. Must be an enemy Phantom, different from Attacker.
- **Execute Battle (B):** Performs damage calculation.
- **Cancel Attack (N):** Clears battle state.
- **0 Health in Battle:** Phantoms with 0 Health deal no damage and are forced to Defense.
- **Excess Damage to LP:** Only from Attack Position Phantoms that are targets.
- **Keyword Automation:** We will be building on the automated keywords over time. Trying to impliment what is possible in stages, while insuring functionality building things out further in the future.

# --- Multi-Player Sync ---
- All major game actions (moves, flips, rotations, stat changes, battle steps, SP changes) must be synchronized between players.
- Use `flipZoneId` for zones, but card IDs are universal.

# --- Developer & Road Map ---
- Refer to `TCG_Roadmap.md` for prioritized tasks and future features.
- Refer to `TCG_Dev_Guidebook.md` for overall vision and design philosophy.
