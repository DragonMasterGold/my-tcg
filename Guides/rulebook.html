</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Both Players draw a card from their Main Deck during the Draw Phase.
</p>
<p>
    Which is after Player 1’s turn and before and Player 2’s turn.
</p>
<p>
    During the Draw Phase if you draw a card but have no cards left in your Deck
    you lose.
</p>
<p>
    Two turns is a Round. When Player 2 ends their turn a new Round begins.
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
    The back row three slots are for Spirits/Counters.
</p>

    to them.
</p>
<p align="center">

    <br clear="all"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    Phantom Info:
</p>
<p>
    To Summon a Phantom you pay it’s SP Cost which starts equal to its level.
</p>
<p>
    A Special Summon is a Summon that does not cost SP to perform.
</p>
<p>
    Phantoms can be Unsummoned to receive their SP back on your turn.
</p>
<p>
    Phantoms cannot be Unsummoned on the same turn they have Battled.
</p>
<p>
    Phantoms can be Summoned in Attack or Defense both face up or face down.
</p>
<p>
    Phantom Cards can’t Direct Attack the turn they are summoned.
</p>
<p>
    If a Phantom is Attacked and takes more Damage than it has Health, if it is
    in Attack Position, the excess Damage is delt to the controlling player.
</p>
<p>
    Defense Position Phantoms do not pass on excess Damage to the Player.
</p>
<p>
    Defense position Phantoms cannot Attack.
</p>
<p>
    Phantoms cannot activate their Abilities while face down (unless otherwise
    stated).
</p>
<p>
    Phantoms on the field with 0 Health are automatically placed in Defense
    Position.
</p>
<p>
    They cannot be taken out of Defense Position.
</p>
<p>
    If a card survives a Break after having their Health reduced to 0, they stay
    at 0 Health.
</p>
<p>
    Phantoms with 0 Health in Defense position do not inflict damage in Battle
    to the Attacking Phantom. <br clear="all"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    Other Card Types:
</p>
<p>
    Sprits must be played onto the field to be activated. They can only be
    activated on the Player’s turn. They can be set face down on the field.
</p>
<p>
    Counter Cards must be set onto the field to activate. They can be Activated
    on the opponent’s turn. They can be activated on the Player’s turn, except
    for the turn they are set, unless their Condition is met.
</p>
<p>
    Environment Cards are placed in their Player’s Environment Slot.
</p>
<p>
    Environment Cards effect and can be used by both players when only one is on
    the field. When two are on the field, only the Environment card on your side
    of the field effects only you and your cards.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p align="center">
    Lines:
</p>
<p>
    Cards can respond to other cards. And when they do they start a Line.
</p>
<p>
    Each Ability is added as a Step to the Line.
</p>
<p>
    Every Ability has a Speed, only equal to or greater Speed Abilities can be
    activated in response to another card.
</p>
<p>
    When a higher Speed Ability activates in response, a Line Break occurs, and
    a new Line begins.
</p>
<p>
    You can only activate Abilities in response to the previously Step on the
    current Line.
</p>
<p>
    Once a Line starts to Resolve neither player can activate Abilities in
    response.
</p>
<p>
    Once a Line resolves, up to where a Line Break occurred, you gain a window
    to activate a new card in response to the highest Step card of that Line and
    build the Line steps further and/or cause another Line Break.
</p>
<p>
    Game actions such as playing a card or initiating an Attack are Speed 0.
</p>
<p>
    Phantom and Spirit Abilities are by default Speed 1.
</p>
<p>
    Counter Abilities are by default Speed 2.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p align="center">
    Extra Rulings:
</p>
<p>
    In the events of a potentially infinite loop, a single game action cannot be
    performed more than 10 times in a single turn.
